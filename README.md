In the past quarter, I completed key ServiceNow training programs that enhanced my technical skills and platform knowledge. This has helped me approach development tasks more efficiently and with greater confidence. I also supported the team by applying new insights to ongoing work and improving existing processes.


One area for improvement could be transitioning more quickly from training to active development work. While the training was valuable, I could have been more proactive in seeking hands-on opportunities earlier. This would have helped me ramp up faster for the current project.


To develop the skills identified in my goals, I completed relevant ServiceNow training modules and hands-on labs. I also explored platform documentation and best practices to deepen my understanding. Applying these learnings in my current project has helped reinforce and grow my development skills.

At this point, I feel I have the support I need to develop my skills and achieve my goals. I am confident in my ability to continue progressing independently, utilizing the resources available to me and applying my knowledge to current and future projects.
