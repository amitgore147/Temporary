Dear Sowmiya,

I hope you’re doing well. I recently completed the ACON Bridge Program training in ServiceNow and have earned certifications in CSA, CAD, and ITSM. I am now looking for a ServiceNow development project where I can apply my skills and continue growing in this field.

If you know of any suitable opportunities, I would be grateful if you could consider me for the role.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,  
[Your Name]
