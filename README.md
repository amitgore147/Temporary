Here’s a sample answer that combines your contributions, career aspirations, and growth goals:

---

**“Over the past year, I've made significant contributions by supporting various tools and platforms that are critical to our operations, including ServiceNow, SolarWinds, Rubrik, AWS, and CyberArk. In ServiceNow, I managed incident and service requests, resolved complex issues, and provided support for workflows, which helped streamline our operations. With SolarWinds, I monitored network health, identified performance bottlenecks, and resolved issues quickly to minimize downtime. Additionally, my work with Rubrik and AWS involved managing data backup and recovery processes and providing cloud infrastructure support, which has enhanced our data protection and availability. For CyberArk, I ensured secure access management, helping protect our sensitive information.

Looking ahead, my career aspiration is to transition from support to ServiceNow development, where I can apply my experience to create and optimize solutions that prevent issues rather than respond to them. I’m particularly interested in pursuing more advanced certifications in ServiceNow, as well as developing expertise in related areas like cloud integrations and security, which would complement my background and enhance my contributions.

In terms of career growth, I’m working towards roles like ServiceNow Architect or Development Lead, where I can leverage my technical and operational knowledge to drive platform improvements and mentor others in best practices. My goal is to make a lasting impact on the organization by building more efficient, automated, and secure workflows.”**
