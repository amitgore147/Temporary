This year, I recognize there were areas for improvement. While I improved in ticket resolution, there were instances where I could have prioritized better to address more critical issues first. I also realized that my AWS knowledge, though growing, could benefit from deeper expertise, especially in advanced cloud security and cost optimization practices. Additionally, I could have been more proactive in sharing knowledge and training newer team members. Lastly, I believe there is room for enhancing my ability to handle multiple high-priority tasks without feeling stretched thin during peak times.
