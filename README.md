If the `incident.notify_caller` event doesn't exist, that explains why the notification isn't being sent. To fix this, you will need to **create the event** and ensure it's properly configured. Follow these steps to create the event and ensure the notification works:

### Step 1: Create the `incident.notify_caller` Event
1. **Navigate to the Event Registration**:
   - Go to **System Policy** → **Events** → **Event Registry**.
   
2. **Create a New Event**:
   - Click **New** to create a new event.
   
3. **Fill in the Event Details**:
   - **Event Name**: Enter the event name as `incident.notify_caller`.
   - **Table**: Set the table to **Incident [incident]**.
   - **Description**: Add a description for clarity (e.g., "Notify the caller when the incident is updated").

4. **Submit**: After entering the details, click **Submit** to save the event.

### Step 2: Trigger the Event in Your Script
Now that the event has been registered, update your script to use the new event. The script you provided already contains the correct code to trigger the event using `gs.eventQueue()`:

```javascript
(function() {
    // Get the incident record
    var inc = new GlideRecord('incident');
    inc.get(event.instance);
    
    // Prepare notification details
    var caller = inc.caller_id.getRefRecord(); // Get the caller record
    var incidentNumber = inc.number; // Get the incident number
    
    // Prepare a notification message
    var message = 'Incident ' + incidentNumber + ' has been updated.';
    
    // Send the event to notify the caller
    gs.eventQueue('incident.notify_caller', inc, caller, message);
})();
```

### Step 3: Create a Notification for the Event
Now that the event exists, you need to create a notification that responds to this event.

1. **Navigate to Notifications**:
   - Go to **System Notification** → **Notifications**.

2. **Create a New Notification**:
   - Click **New** to create a new notification.

3. **Configure the Notification**:
   - **Name**: Enter a name like "Notify Caller of Incident".
   - **Table**: Set the table to **Incident [incident]**.
   - **Event Name**: Select the event you just created, `incident.notify_caller`.
   - **Who will receive**: Set the recipient as the **Caller**. You can use the **Caller** field from the incident.

4. **Message Content**:
   - You can use the `${event.parm3}` placeholder to include the custom message from your script:
     ```html
     <p>${event.parm3}</p> <!-- Message sent from the script -->
     ```

5. **Conditions (Optional)**:
   - You can specify conditions under **When to send**, for example, if you only want this to trigger under specific circumstances (e.g., when the incident is active).

6. **Submit**: Save the notification by clicking **Submit**.

### Step 4: Test the Event and Notification
- Now that the event is created and the notification is set up, you can test it:
  - Create or update an incident to trigger the event via your script.
  - The event `incident.notify_caller` should now trigger the notification, and the caller should receive the email.

### Step 5: Verify in Email Logs
- After testing, go to **System Mailboxes** → **Outbound** → **Sent** to verify that the email was sent.
- Also, check **System Logs** → **Events** to ensure that the `incident.notify_caller` event is being triggered.

By following these steps, you will create the necessary event and set up the notification, allowing the caller to receive notifications as intended.
