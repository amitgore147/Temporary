To create a **script action**, an **event**, and a **notification** in ServiceNow to notify a caller of an incident, follow these steps:

### 1. **Create a Script Action**

A Script Action in ServiceNow is typically executed when an event is fired. We'll create a script action that runs when the event is triggered (e.g., incident creation or update).

#### Steps to create a Script Action:
1. Navigate to **System Policy > Events > Script Actions**.
2. Click **New** to create a new Script Action.
3. Fill out the required fields:
   - **Name**: NotifyCallerOfIncident (or a similar name)
   - **Table**: Incident
   - **Event Name**: (We will create the event next)
   - **Condition**: Add any conditions if necessary (e.g., only for Priority 1 incidents).
   - **Script**: Add the script logic to notify the caller.

Example script:
```javascript
(function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) {
    // Get the caller's email
    var callerEmail = current.caller_id.email;
    var incidentNumber = current.number;
    
    // Trigger the notification
    gs.eventQueue('incident.notify.caller', current, callerEmail, incidentNumber);
})(current, previous);
```

4. Save the Script Action.

### 2. **Create an Event**

Events are triggered and can be used to notify users via notifications.

#### Steps to create an Event:
1. Navigate to **System Policy > Events > Registry**.
2. Click **New** to create a new event.
3. Fill out the fields:
   - **Name**: incident.notify.caller
   - **Table**: Incident
   - **Description**: Event to notify the caller when an incident is updated or created.
4. Save the event.

### 3. **Create a Notification**

A Notification in ServiceNow sends messages to users based on conditions or events.

#### Steps to create a Notification:
1. Navigate to **System Notification > Email > Notifications**.
2. Click **New** to create a new notification.
3. Fill out the required fields:
   - **Name**: Notify Caller of Incident
   - **Table**: Incident
   - **When to Send**: Trigger on the **Event** we created (`incident.notify.caller`).
   - **Who will Receive**: 
     - Add **Email (Script)** and use this script:
       ```javascript
       return event.parm1;
       ```
   - **What it will contain**: Write the email template to include relevant details.

Example message:
```
Hello,

An incident has been created/updated. Here are the details:

Incident Number: ${event.parm2}
Short Description: ${current.short_description}
Status: ${current.state}

Please contact the service desk for further details.

Thank you.
```

4. Save the notification.

### 4. **Test the Setup**
1. Create or update an incident in ServiceNow.
2. The event should fire, triggering the script action and sending the notification to the callerâ€™s email.

This completes the setup for notifying the caller when an incident is created or updated.
