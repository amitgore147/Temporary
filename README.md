This year, I improved my efficiency in resolving support tickets using ServiceNow, reducing response times and increasing customer satisfaction. I proactively monitored systems with SolarWinds and CyberArk, catching issues early and minimizing downtime. I also enhanced my skills in AWS, optimizing cloud resource management for cost savings and security. With Rubrik, I contributed to more reliable backups and disaster recovery processes. Finally, I helped improve team collaboration through effective use of Jira, ensuring smooth coordination and tracking of tasks. Overall, these efforts led to better operational stability and team performance.
